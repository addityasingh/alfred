Considerations for picking package and language setup

- [x] The server side code should be debuggable with `node inspect`
- [x] Minimum size: Use `micro` server
- [ ] Type safe: 
    - [x] Use `Typescript` for server
    - [x] `flow` for client
- [ ] Declarative: 
    - [ ] Use `Relay` for GraphQL client 
    - [x] `Apollo` for GraphQL server
- [ ] Easy to deploy: Use `Kubernetes` with GCP
- [ ] Easy to test: 
    - [ ]Unit test using `Jest`
- [ ] Easy to make changes across codebase: `Lerna` for monorepo 
- [ ] Easy to work within a team: 
    - [ ] Use `CONTRIBUTING guidelines` 
    - [ ] `prettier`
